Electronic engineer entrepreneur, self-taught, responsible, creative and goal-oriented. He is a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science & Engineering at Lehigh University under the supervision of **[Prof. David Saldaña](http://davidsaldana.co/)**. He belongs to **[Swarms lab](http://swarmslab.com/)** and **[Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics Laboratory AIRLab](https://robotics.lehigh.edu/)** at Lehigh University. He is a candidate to earn an MSc. in control engineering at the University of Ibague, Colombia, under the direction of **[Prof. Oswaldo Lopez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ICaDWRsAAAAJ&hl)**. 

He worked for a company called **[Ideas Disruptivas](https://ideasdisruptivas.com/)** in Mexico, where, as a project manager, he helped develop the first Mexican 3D printer with a clear educational purpose. The most outstanding project I have worked on is called **[pretty hand](https://diegosdantonio.netlify.app/project/prettyhand/)** where a mechanical-electronic hand was designed for people needing hand prosthesis; it was a low-cost social project.

During my master’s degree, I was chair of the IEEE student branch chapter and chair industrial application society at the University of Ibague.

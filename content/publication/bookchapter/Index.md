abstract: "This chapter illustrates the use of hysteresis control techniques applied to multilevel inverters. Firstly, a general classification of different methods applied to control multilevel inverters is presented considering three main point-of-view: according to the switching frequency (fundamental frequency and high frequency), according to the related application (grid-tie and stand-alone) and according to the kind of control they use (linear and nonlinear). Into this frame, the contents of the chapter introduces the hysteresis-based control methods presenting an overview of the existing literature. Thus, both hysteresis current control (HCC) and hysteresis voltage control (HVC) are considered to illustrate the use of the technique in grid-connected and stand-alone applications, respectively. In the case of HCC, the three more relevant techniques are detailed: Multiband (MB) HCC, Multi off-set band (MOB) HCC and Time-based (TB) HCC. Similarly, for HVC, two methods are explained: multiband (MB) HVC and hysteresis voltage regulation (HVR). Finally, based on the overview of the existing techniques, an alternative HVC method is proposed for first time in this chapter. This control can be classified as a low-frequency adaptive hysteresis band technique suitable for stand-alone applications. The theoretical fundaments of the control are provided using a particular topology of transformer based cascade multilevel inverter selected as a case study. Validation of the technique effectiveness is supported using simulation results in which the control ensures the output voltage shape by changing the number of output levels from 27 to 35 and simultaneously adapting the wide of the hysteresis band according with the input voltage and load conditions."
